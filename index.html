                To achieve my goal I set a time for practising regularly and trying to commit my files in github.

            <p>If you don't know where you are going,
                you'll end up someplace else. So to follow a fixed plan is important . By following a particular work
                plan, I am maintaining my time to work for my goal beside my study. </p>

                <h1>Create a profile for you</h1>
                <p>An online portfolio is certain to make you available and searchable for new clients. It lets your
                    potential employers find you the moment they get round to using a search engine or looking through
                    candidatesâ€™ applications.
                    A portfolio published on the web humanizes you as a master of the craft. People come to you not only
                    for you being an outstanding web designer, marketer or copywriter, but because they like you. </p>
